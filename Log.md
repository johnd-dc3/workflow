**5/24/22** Tuesday
- Worked on Japanese presentation and studied Japanese.
- Learned how to set up and configure a simple tailwind.css project see `exercises/css-frameworks`

**5/25/22** Wednesday
- Spent a lot of time trying to get `git rm --cached` to work. I wanted to remove all files other than theme files from the ssr990 repo. Everything works (see notes added to Git reference) EXCEPT when I `git pull` to update from origin, the files are deleted (forever! because they are no longer git tracked) on my local. The only work around would be to copy the files I want to ignore prior to removing from cache, and pasting them in after the fact. With so many different files, I ended up creating a new repo instead.
- Worked on resume, adding projects

**5/26/22** Thursday
- Practice presentation
- Study Bootstrap navbar (mainly flex properties)
- Create Tailwind navbar to look like bootstrap
