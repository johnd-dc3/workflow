# Terminology
## Basic Terminology
  - A **hash** is an associative array of unique keys and their values
    - Alternative syntax can be used when defining the key names of a hash, using `:` at the end of the hash name, thus converting the key name into a symbol.
    ```
    { foo: 1, bar: 2 }
    #=> {:foo=>1, :bar=>2}
    ```
  - A **symbol** is a literal, static name that doesn't change, and is designated by a `:` in front of the name. Example: `:articles`. Controller names, for example, are defined as symbles. Symbols are memory efficient
  - An **instance variable** (ex.: `@variableName`) is restricted to the object that itself refers to

## Model
- A model is a Ruby class that can add, find, update, and remove data from a database (CRUD). Rails automatically generates models.
- Use the generate command to build a model:
  `bin/rails generate model ModelName ColumnOneName:ColumnOneType ColumnTwoName:ColumnTwoType`
  Ex.: `bin/rails generate model Article title:string body:text'
- The above model generation **creates the constructor class Articles for the article object** This object will later be accessed by used of an instance varialbe in the controller
- Generating the model will also generate a migration file. Migrations define changes that will be made to the database. Migration files defined in Ruby are database-agnositc

## Migration File
Here is an example of a migration file automatically generated when a model was generated:
```
class CreateArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    create_table :articles do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.text :body

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```
- `CreateArticles` was automatically generated when the `Article` model was generated. `CreateArticles` inherits the functionality of ActiveRecord's Migration class. The Migrations class in ActiveRecord contains helper methods that perform CRUD operations, like addtable, addcolumn, and rename_table. These are the types of things we want our class to do, so it inherits those methods, giving our class the ability to perform them.
- The `change` method is defined by default as a constructive migration method. It will generate a table with the specified columns as well as timestamps for creation and updates

## Controller
The controller uses the model to access the database in some way
- Controllers can be generated in the bash terminal using the following:
  `bin/rails generate controller ControllerName actionName --skip-routes`. Note that `--skip-routes` is optional
- Once the controller is generated, the controller file will be generated. Ex: `app/controllers/articles_controller.rb`
- Additionally, a view will be generated by default. Ex: `app/views/articles/index.html.erb`
- The Controller makes use of **instance variables** (ex.: `@articles`). When an action is triggered (E.g.: user clicks on New button), an instance of the controller is created and the `new` method is called. At that point, any instance variables defined are available to any method or view that is the result of that action. **This is especially important for connecting variable data between the controller and the view**

## Routes
Connect incoming HTTP requests to application and generates URLS (no hard coded URLS)
- **routes.rb** is a single block sent to `ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw`
- Routes assign a controller and an action to a URL. I.e.: routes will map a URL _to_ an action _of_ a controller
- URLs are mapped by the controller's action (GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH, PUT)
- `resources` routings iwll difine all common routes for a controller
- RESTful routes use the following declaration style: `resources :controller-name`
- Models that are dependen upon other models must be nested

# Initial Setup
Assuming you have Ruby and Rails already installed:
1. Create your app: `rails new blog --skip-spring --skip-listen` (Note: this is specifically for Linux running on a Windows subsystem)
3. Start app: `bin/rails server` to confirm it is connected
4. Add your first route, for example:
  ```
  Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root "articles#index"
  end
  ```
5. Generate your controller from bash terminal: `bin/rails generate controller Articles index --skip-routes`
6. Generate your model: `bin/rails generate model Article title:string body:text
7. Run your migration: `bin/rails db:migrate`
